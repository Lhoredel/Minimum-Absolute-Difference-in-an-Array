# Minimum-Absolute-Difference-in-an-Array
This code solves the Minimum Absolute Difference in an Array problem by finding the smallest absolute difference between any two elements. It first sorts the array to ensure that the minimum difference occurs between adjacent elements in the sorted order. The algorithm then scans consecutive pairs, calculating their absolute differences and tracking the smallest value found.
